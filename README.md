# MyStructure

## About
MyStructure is a web application that allows you to create detailed TODO lists.
It also allows you to view progress in a multitude of ways. The background colour
of a task indicates task completion status, with red meaning incomplete, and green
meaning that the task is complete. There is also a progress bar, which illustrates
overall task completion for a particular day.

## Recent UI improvements
MyStructure has recently been given a facelift, to make it more friendly, and hopefully easier to use.

The following things have changed:
* New colour theme for the banner and footer.
* Inclusion of a banner, with an image that has been specifically chosen to inspire action.
* Inclusion of a read-only field for the current date, so that users do not accidently schedule
events in the past, or schedule today's events on a future day.
* Event actions are now located below the event description, to create a consistent experience
across all devices.
